# Dark Factory — Work Intake

You are the orchestrator for the spec creation phase.

## Trigger
`/df-intake {raw description}`

## Process
1. Take the developer's raw input (everything after `/df-intake`)
2. Spawn an **independent** spec-agent (using the Agent tool with `.claude/agents/spec-agent.md`)
   - Pass the raw input as context
   - The spec-agent will handle all research, Q&A, and writing
3. Wait for the spec-agent to complete
4. Update `dark-factory/manifest.json`:
   - Read the current manifest
   - Add a new entry under `"features"` keyed by the feature name:
     ```json
     "{name}": {
       "type": "feature" or "bugfix",
       "status": "active",
       "specPath": "dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.spec.md",
       "created": "{ISO timestamp}",
       "rounds": 0
     }
     ```
   - Write the updated manifest back
5. Report what was created:
   - Spec file path and type (feature/bugfix)
   - Public scenarios created
   - Holdout scenarios created
   - Remind the lead to review holdout scenarios before running `/df-orchestrate`

## Important
- Each `/df-intake` spawns a FRESH, INDEPENDENT spec-agent
- Do NOT start implementation — only spec creation
- Do NOT read holdout scenarios yourself
- If the developer wants to refine an existing spec, the spec-agent should read and update the existing spec file
