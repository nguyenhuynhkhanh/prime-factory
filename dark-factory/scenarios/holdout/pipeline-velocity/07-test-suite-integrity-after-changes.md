# Scenario: Test suite passes after all changes with correct assertion updates

## Type
regression

## Priority
critical -- the test suite is the project's structural integrity check

## Preconditions
- All pipeline-velocity changes have been implemented:
  - df-orchestrate SKILL.md updated with parallel review
  - architect-agent.md updated with domain parameterization
  - code-agent.md updated with findings input
  - dark-factory.md rules updated
  - init-dark-factory.js deleted
  - tests updated

## Action
Run `node --test tests/dark-factory-setup.test.js`

## Expected Outcome
- All tests pass (zero failures)
- Suite 1 (Agent definitions): All 7 agents still exist with valid frontmatter. architect-agent.md still has name "architect-agent" in frontmatter.
- Suite 2 (Skill definitions): All 7 skills still exist with valid frontmatter.
- Suite 3 (Directory structure): Unchanged -- all dirs still exist.
- Suite 4 (Pipeline routing): Unchanged -- df-intake is feature-only, df-debug is bug-only, df-orchestrate detects mode.
- Suite 5 (Architect review): Updated assertions reflect parallel domain model. No longer asserts "minimum 3 rounds" or "at least 3 rounds". Instead asserts domain parameter, parallel review, and findings forwarding.
- Suite 6 (Information barriers): All barrier tests pass. New assertion that findings forwarding strips round discussion.
- Suite 7-9: Unchanged.
- Suite 10 (Init script scaffold): Entirely removed -- no tests reference `init-dark-factory.js`.
- Suite 11 (CLAUDE.md): Updated if pipeline descriptions changed.

## Failure Mode (if applicable)
If tests are partially updated (e.g., "minimum 3 rounds" assertion removed but no replacement added), the test suite loses coverage of the architect review behavior.

## Notes
The test count will decrease (init script tests removed) but may increase (new parallel review tests added). The key metric is zero failures, not test count.
