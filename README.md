# Dark Factory

**Specs in, production-grade features out.**

Dark Factory is an open-source multi-agent framework for Claude Code. Just describe what you need — it assembles a team of AI specialists who research, challenge, implement, and validate autonomously. No agent can cut corners because no agent has the full picture.

> Inspired by [The Dark Factory Pattern](https://hackernoon.com/the-dark-factory-pattern-moving-from-ai-assisted-to-fully-autonomous-coding) — moving from AI-assisted to fully autonomous coding.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed

### Install as Claude Code Plugin (recommended)

Inside any Claude Code session, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add nguyenhuynhkhanh/dark-factory
/plugin install dark-factory@dark-factory-marketplace
```

That's it — Dark Factory is now available across **all** your projects. The plugin auto-updates when new versions are pushed.

### Alternative: npm (per-project install)

```bash
npx dark-factory init
```

This copies agents, skills, and rules into the current project only. To update later: `npx dark-factory update`

### Get started

1. Open Claude Code in your project
2. Run `/df-onboard` to map your project's architecture
3. Just describe what you need — Dark Factory activates automatically

---

## Usage

### Just describe what you need

You don't need to remember any commands. Just tell Claude Code what you want:

```
I need an API endpoint that lets users export their data as CSV
```

Dark Factory auto-detects this is a feature and routes it through the pipeline. If it's a bug report, it routes to the debug pipeline instead. If it can't tell, it asks.

You can also start with a question — "how does the auth system work?" — and when the conversation evolves into a concrete plan, Dark Factory activates at that moment.

### What happens next

**For features:**
1. **3 spec leads** research in parallel (user/product, architecture, reliability perspectives)
2. Findings are synthesized → you confirm scope
3. **Smart decomposition**: large features are automatically split into smaller, independent specs with declared dependencies — you confirm the split
4. Spec(s) + scenarios written → holdout scenarios shown inline for your review
5. Architect review: 3 parallel domain-focused reviews (security, architecture, API) for every spec
6. Implementation in parallel worktrees: each spec gets its own worktree, with up to 4 code-agents per spec → test-agent validates
7. On success: holdout tests promoted into your permanent test suite, artifacts cleaned up (git history is the archive)

**For bugs:**
1. **3 investigators** research in parallel (code path tracer, history detective, pattern analyst)
2. Findings synthesized → you confirm diagnosis → debug report + scenarios written
3. Strict red-green cycle: failing test first (proves bug), then minimal fix (no test changes)
4. Holdout validation, promote tests, cleanup artifacts

### Explicit commands (optional)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/df {description}` | Auto-detect bug vs feature, route to right pipeline |
| `/df-onboard` | Map project architecture, conventions, quality bar |
| `/df-intake {desc}` | Create feature spec (3 parallel leads, synthesized) |
| `/df-debug {desc}` | Investigate bug (3 parallel investigators, synthesized) |
| `/df-orchestrate {name} [name2...]` | Implement specs in parallel worktrees (architect review → code → test → promote → cleanup) |
| `/df-cleanup` | Recover stuck features, list stale work |
| `/df-spec` | Show spec templates for manual writing |
| `/df-scenario` | Show scenario templates for manual writing |

## Why Dark Factory?

AI coding assistants write code fast, but fast code on a flawed spec is fast failure. They skip architecture review, miss security concerns, and can't validate their own work honestly — they wrote both the code and the tests.

Dark Factory separates concerns into independent agents with strict information barriers:

| What goes wrong without it | How Dark Factory prevents it |
|---|---|
| AI guesses the scope instead of asking | 3 spec-agents research from different perspectives — user, architecture, reliability |
| AI skips architecture review | Architect-agent reviews every spec with 3 parallel domain-focused reviews (security, architecture, API) |
| AI writes tests that match its own implementation | Test-agent uses **holdout scenarios** the code-agent has never seen |
| Bug fixes that mask symptoms | 3 debug-agents investigate from different angles; strict red-green cycle prevents symptom-masking |
| AI doesn't understand the existing codebase | Onboard-agent maps architecture, conventions, and quality bar before any work begins |
| Small changes get stuck in heavy process | Parallel domain reviews run fast — same depth in 1/3 the wall-clock time, test-agent is the safety net |
| AI forgets migration plans for production data | Every spec requires a mandatory Migration & Deployment section — existing data, rollback, stale cache, deployment order |
| Specs get updated but scenarios don't | Scenario re-evaluation is mandatory after every spec change during architect review — no exceptions |

---

## How It Works

### The 7 Agents

| Agent | Role | How it works |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Onboard** | Maps the project before any work begins | Analyzes codebase → produces project profile |
| **Spec** (x3) | Discovers scope, challenges assumptions, writes specs | 3 leads research in parallel from different perspectives |
| **Debug** (x3) | Forensic root cause analysis, impact assessment | 3 investigators run in parallel — code path, history, patterns |
| **Architect** | Reviews specs for architecture, security, performance | 3 parallel domain-focused reviews for every spec |
| **Code** (x1-4) | Implements features and fixes | Auto-scaled parallel sessions within a worktree-isolated spec |
| **Test** | Validates with hidden scenarios | Unit tests + Playwright e2e (auto-detected) |
| **Promote** | Moves holdout tests into permanent test suite | Adapts both unit and e2e tests to project conventions |

### Information Barriers

The key innovation. Each agent has **strict boundaries** on what it can see:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │              Project Profile                 │
                    │  (all agents except test/promote can read)   │
                    └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    ┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐          ┌──────────┐
    │   Spec   │          │   Code   │          │   Test   │
    │  Agent   │          │  Agent   │          │  Agent   │
    │          │          │          │          │          │
    │ Sees:    │          │ Sees:    │          │ Sees:    │
    │ codebase │          │ spec,    │          │ spec,    │
    │ docs     │          │ PUBLIC   │          │ HOLDOUT  │
    │          │          │ scenarios│          │ scenarios│
    │ Cannot:  │          │          │          │          │
    │ holdout  │          │ Cannot:  │          │ Cannot:  │
    │ results  │          │ HOLDOUT  │          │ PUBLIC   │
    └──────────┘          │ results  │          │ scenarios│
                          └──────────┘          └──────────┘

    ┌──────────┐
    │Architect │  Can see: spec, codebase, project profile
    │  Agent   │  CANNOT see: ANY scenarios (public or holdout)
    │          │  CANNOT discuss tests with other agents
    └──────────┘
```

The code-agent can't "teach to the test" because it never sees the holdout scenarios. The architect can't compromise test coverage because it never sees tests at all. The test-agent can't soften its validation because it doesn't know what the code-agent was told to build.

### Red-Green Cycle (Bugfixes)

Strict discipline that prevents the most common AI failure mode: fixing the symptom instead of the root cause.

```
Phase 1 (Red):   Write test   →  Test FAILS  ✓  (bug is real)
                 ⚠ Zero source code changes allowed

Phase 2 (Green): Implement fix →  Test PASSES ✓  (fix works)
                 ⚠ Zero test file changes allowed
                 ⚠ All existing tests must still pass
```

### Feature Lifecycle

Every feature is tracked in `dark-factory/manifest.json` while active:

```
active → passed → promoted → cleaned up
  │         │         │          │
  │         │         │          └── Artifacts committed to git, then deleted
  │         │         └── Holdout tests in permanent test suite
  │         └── All holdout tests passed
  └── Spec created, awaiting implementation
```

Completed features are removed from the manifest — it only tracks in-progress work. All artifacts are in git history if you ever need them. `/df-cleanup` recovers features stuck in intermediate states.

## Design Decisions

**Why git worktree isolation?** — Each spec implementation runs in its own [git worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) — a separate working directory on an isolated branch. When you run `/df-orchestrate spec-a spec-b spec-c`, Dark Factory analyzes dependencies between specs, groups them into waves, and runs independent specs in parallel worktrees. Foundation specs (e.g., project init, shared data models) complete first; dependent specs wait. Each spec can scale up to 4 internal code-agents, so 3 parallel specs could mean 12 agents running simultaneously.

**Why massive parallelism?** — Speed without cutting corners. Within a single spec: 3 spec leads research in parallel, 3 debug investigators trace different angles, 1-4 code-agents implement different tracks. Across specs: dependency-aware worktree isolation runs independent specs concurrently while respecting ordering constraints.

**Why 3 parallel leads/investigators?** — A single agent has blind spots. Three agents with different lenses (user, architecture, reliability for features; code path, history, patterns for bugs) catch more issues and produce a more complete spec.

**Why holdout scenarios?** — Without them, the AI writes code and tests from the same understanding. Holdout scenarios are written by the spec-agent and validated by the test-agent. The code-agent must implement correctly to pass tests it's never seen.

**Why parallel domain review for every spec?** — Quality is non-negotiable. Every spec gets 3 parallel domain-focused architect reviews (security, architecture, API). Same depth as sequential rounds, but in 1/3 the wall-clock time. Each domain goes deeper than a generalist doing one pass.

**Why auto-scaled code-agents?** — A large spec with independent tracks can be implemented faster with multiple agents working in parallel. Combined with worktree-level isolation per spec, you can run many implementations concurrently without any conflicts.

**Why unit + Playwright?** — The test-agent auto-detects available test infrastructure and classifies each scenario as unit test, e2e test, or both. If Playwright isn't installed, it suggests it for UI scenarios but doesn't block.

**Why strict red-green for bugs?** — The most dangerous AI bug fix changes the test to match the broken behavior. Dark Factory enforces: write the test first (no code changes), then fix the code (no test changes).

**Why `.claude/rules/` instead of CLAUDE.md?** — Dark Factory instructions load automatically from `.claude/rules/dark-factory.md` without touching your project's `CLAUDE.md`. Your project settings stay clean.

**Why a Claude Code plugin?** — Install once with `/plugin install`, get Dark Factory across all your projects with auto-updates. No git submodules, no manual copying. The `npx dark-factory init` option is still available for per-project installs if you prefer.
