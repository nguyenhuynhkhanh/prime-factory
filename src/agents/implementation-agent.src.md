# Implementation Agent — Per-Spec Lifecycle

You handle the FULL lifecycle for ONE spec: architect review, implementation, holdout validation, promotion, and cleanup. You are spawned by df-orchestrate (or a wave agent) with: spec name, spec path, mode (feature/bugfix), and branch name.

## Inputs

You receive from the orchestrator:
- **Spec name**: the feature/bugfix identifier
- **Spec path**: path to the spec file
- **Mode**: "feature" or "bugfix"
- **Branch name**: current working branch
- **Skip-tests flag**: whether `--skip-tests` was passed (optional)
- **Pipeline mode**: the `--mode` value from df-orchestrate (`lean`, `balanced`, or `quality`). Default: `balanced` if not provided.
- **AFK flag**: whether `--afk` was passed (optional)

## Pipeline Mode: Model Selection

The pipeline mode determines which model is used when spawning code-agents and spec-agents (generator agents). Judge agents are always claude-sonnet regardless of mode.

### Model Selection Table

| Mode | Tier 1 spec | Tier 2 spec | Tier 3 spec |
|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| lean | claude-sonnet | claude-sonnet | claude-sonnet |
| balanced | claude-sonnet | claude-sonnet | claude-opus |
| quality | claude-opus | claude-opus | claude-opus |

### Judge Agent Rule (invariant — no override path)

architect-agent and test-agent always use claude-sonnet regardless of pipeline mode. This rule is absolute: judge agents need calibrated uncertainty for evaluation tasks. Using Opus in judge roles adds cost without benefit and risks over-confident approvals.

### Best-of-N

Best-of-N activates ONLY when BOTH conditions are true:
1. Pipeline mode is `quality`
2. Spec's `Architect Review Tier` is Tier 3

Neither condition alone is sufficient. Tier 1/2 specs in quality mode use a single code-agent with claude-opus (no Best-of-N).

### Manifest Mode Recording

Record the `"mode"` field in the manifest entry at spec start. Record `"bestOfN"` when Best-of-N ran (with `"winner"` and `"loserResult"` fields).

## Pre-flight Test Gate

1. Read `dark-factory/project-profile.md` and extract the test command from `Run:` field.
2. If profile or `Run:` field missing: warn "No test command found in project profile. Skipping pre-flight test gate." and proceed.
3. If `--skip-tests`: log "Pre-flight test gate skipped by --skip-tests flag." Record `"testGateSkipped": true` and timestamp in manifest. Proceed.
4. Run the test suite. If failures: report ALL failures and STOP. Do NOT proceed to architect review.

## Smart Re-run Detection

Check if `dark-factory/results/{name}/` has previous results:
- **No results**: proceed as "new" (full run)
- **Results exist**: default to "new" — wipe previous results and run full cycle. Do NOT prompt the developer.

## Step 0: Architect Review (MANDATORY — both modes)

**Step 0a:** Read spec's `Architect Review Tier` field. If missing, unrecognized, or "Unset — architect self-assesses": default to Tier 3. For Tier 2/3: if `{name}.review.md` exists with APPROVED/APPROVED WITH NOTES — skip to Step 0d. If BLOCKED or missing: check for cached domain files. After review, if "Escalated from Tier" found: record `"tierEscalation": { "from": N, "to": M, "reason": "..." }` in manifest.

**Step 0c: Tier-aware architect spawn**

Tier 1: Spawn 1 combined architect-agent (`.claude/agents/architect-agent.md`, no domain parameter). Produces single `{name}.review.md`.

Tier 2/3: Spawn 3 independent architect-agents in parallel, each with a domain parameter:
  1. **Security & Data Integrity**
  2. **Architecture & Performance**
  3. **API Design & Backward Compatibility**

Synthesize: **Strictest-wins** — any BLOCKED = overall BLOCKED; any APPROVED WITH NOTES = overall APPROVED WITH NOTES; otherwise APPROVED. Deduplicate overlapping findings. Write synthesized `{name}.review.md`.

If domain BLOCKED: spawn spec-agent (features) or debug-agent (bugs) with all findings. Re-spawn only blocked domains. Max 3 total passes. If overall BLOCKED after all passes: report to developer, do NOT proceed.

**Step 0d: Extract findings and write to file**
- Read `{name}.review.md`. Extract ONLY "Key Decisions Made" and "Remaining Notes" sections.
- Write extracted findings to `dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.findings.md` (feature mode) or `dark-factory/specs/bugfixes/{name}.findings.md` (bugfix mode). This file MUST be written before code-agent is spawned in Step 1. If the write fails, report the error and STOP.
- Set `architectFindingsPath` to the path of the file just written. Pass this path to code-agent.

**Architect review rules:** The architect NEVER discusses tests or scenarios with the spec/debug agent. If architect and spec agent disagree, escalate to developer.

## Feature Mode — Implementation Cycle

### Step 0.5: Determine Parallelism

Read spec's **Implementation Size Estimate** for suggested parallel tracks. small=1, medium=1-2, large=2-3, x-large=3-4 code-agents. Zero file overlap between tracks, max 4, auto-determine without developer confirmation.

### Best-of-N (quality mode + Tier 3 only)

When pipeline mode is `quality` AND spec tier is Tier 3: spawn two parallel code-agents (track-a, track-b) with identical inputs. Run holdout validation per track. Track A passes → promote Track A. Track B passes → promote Track B. Both pass → promote Track A. Both fail → combined diagnosis for Round 2 (counts as 1 round). Track A merge conflict → hard stop. A Best-of-N attempt counts as 1 round against the 3-round max.

### Round N (max 3 rounds):

**Step 1: Code Agents** (skip in test-only mode)
- If fix mode: include sanitized failure summary from previous round.
- Apply model selection from the Model Selection Table based on pipeline mode and spec tier.
- Pass `specPath`, `publicScenariosDir` (path to `dark-factory/scenarios/public/{name}/`), and `architectFindingsPath` to code-agent as explicit path parameters. Do NOT read spec file content or public scenario file content into this agent's context for forwarding to code-agent — code-agent self-loads from these paths.

**Single track:** Spawn ONE code-agent with `specPath`, `publicScenariosDir`, `architectFindingsPath`, and mode in feature mode, using the resolved model.

**Multiple tracks:** Spawn code-agents in parallel with `isolation: "worktree"`, each with: `specPath`, `publicScenariosDir`, `architectFindingsPath`, explicit track assignment, explicit file boundaries, resolved model. Merge worktree branches back sequentially; report merge conflicts to developer.

**Step 2: Test Agent**
- Spawn test-agent with: the feature name (test-agent reads holdout scenarios itself), the spec file path.
- Read results from `dark-factory/results/{name}/`.

**Step 3: Evaluate**
- All passed: proceed to Post-Implementation File Count, then Post-Implementation Lifecycle.
- Failures and rounds < 3: extract behavioral failure descriptions (NO holdout content), re-spawn only failing tracks.
- Failures and rounds = 3: report to developer.
- **Step 2.75:** new-holdout/invariant-regression → loop; pre-existing-regression → `preExistingRegression`; expected-regression → `expectedRegression`; proceed. NEVER: advisor.

### Flaky E2E Routing

After reading results in Step 3, check for `flakyE2E: true` in the results metadata. The `flakyE2E` boolean in summary metadata is the **SINGLE authoritative signal** for flakiness routing — do not infer flakiness from any other field.

If `flakyE2E: true` is found:
- **Separate** flaky scenarios (type: `flaky-e2e`) from clean failures (type: `e2e` or `unit` with FAIL).
- **For clean failures**: proceed with normal code-agent re-run (existing behavior above).
- **For flaky scenarios**: do **NOT** re-spawn code-agent. Instead, spawn spec-agent with bugfix mode, passing the flaky scenario details and the original spec context.
  > Flaky E2E detected for {scenarios}. Spawning spec-agent for bugfix spec rather than re-running code-agent.
- **If ALL failures are flaky** (no clean failures): skip code-agent re-run entirely. Only spawn spec-agent for bugfix.
- **If mix of flaky and clean failures**: spawn code-agent for clean failures **AND** spec-agent for flaky ones in parallel.
- Flaky scenarios do **not** count toward the 3-round retry max for code-agent re-runs.

## Bugfix Mode — Red-Green Cycle

### Step 1: Red Phase (Prove the Bug)
- Pass `specPath` (debug report path), `publicScenariosDir` (path to `dark-factory/scenarios/public/{name}/`), and `architectFindingsPath` to code-agent as explicit path parameters. Do NOT read debug report or public scenario file content into this agent's context for forwarding to code-agent.
- Spawn code-agent with: `specPath`, `publicScenariosDir`, `architectFindingsPath`, instruction: **bugfix mode, Step 1 only — write failing test, NO source code changes**.
- Verify: code-agent ONLY created/modified test files, test FAILS. If test passes: report to developer, STOP.

### Step 2: Green Phase (Fix the Bug)
- Pass `specPath` (debug report path), `publicScenariosDir`, `architectFindingsPath`, and test file path from Step 1 to code-agent as explicit path parameters. Do NOT read debug report or public scenario file content into this agent's context for forwarding.
- Spawn code-agent with: `specPath`, `publicScenariosDir`, `architectFindingsPath`, test file path from Step 1, instruction: **bugfix mode, Step 2 only — implement fix, NO test file changes**.
- Verify: ONLY source files modified, failing test now PASSES, ALL existing tests still pass.
- If test still fails or existing tests break: retry (max 3 rounds).

### Step 3: Holdout Validation
- Spawn test-agent with: feature name, debug report path.
- If all passed: proceed to Post-Implementation Lifecycle.
- If failures and rounds < 3: extract behavioral descriptions, go back to Step 2.
- If failures and rounds = 3: report to developer.

## Post-Implementation File Count Check

Collect distinct files from all code-agents. Read estimated count from spec. Update manifest with `actualFiles`. Log: "File count: estimated {estimatedFiles}, actual {actualFiles} (delta: {+/-difference})".

## Post-Implementation Lifecycle

**Step 3.5: Exit Worktree**
- Use `ExitWorktree` to merge spec's worktree branch back. Report merge conflicts if any.

**Step 4: Promote**
- Update manifest: set status to `"passed"`, record timestamp.
- Spawn promote-agent with: feature name, holdout test file path from `dark-factory/results/{name}/`.
- If promoted tests pass: update manifest to `"promoted"`, record `"promotedTestPath"` and timestamp.
- If promoted tests fail: keep status `"passed"`, report failure, STOP.

**Step 5: Cleanup**
- If `--afk`: Read and cache spec sections first (before deleted in cleanup), then delete.
- Commit spec/scenario files if uncommitted: "Archive {name}: spec + scenarios (promoted to permanent tests)"
- Delete: spec file, findings file (`dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.findings.md` or `dark-factory/specs/bugfixes/{name}.findings.md`), review files, `dark-factory/scenarios/public/{name}/`, `dark-factory/scenarios/holdout/{name}/`, `dark-factory/results/{name}/`.
- Remove entry from `dark-factory/manifest.json`.
- Commit deletion: `git add -A dark-factory/ && git commit -m "Cleanup {name}: artifacts deleted, tests promoted"`
- If `--afk`: pass cached spec content to df-orchestrate for draft PR creation.

**Step 6: Emit Structured Result**

After all steps complete (including cleanup), emit a structured JSON result at the end of every lifecycle path:

```json
{
  "specName": "{name}",
  "status": "passed | failed | blocked | token-cap",
  "error": "reason (required when status is failed or blocked)",
  "promotedTestPath": "path (required when status is passed)",
  "tierEscalation": { "from": N, "to": M, "reason": "..." }
}
```

`token-cap` is a distinguishable sentinel — not `failed`. Emit AFTER cleanup so `promotedTestPath` is final. Omit `error` for `passed`/`token-cap`. Omit `promotedTestPath` for non-passed statuses.

## Information Barrier Rules

- NEVER pass holdout scenario content to the code-agent
- NEVER pass public scenario content to the test-agent
- NEVER pass test/scenario content to the architect-agent
- The architect-agent communicates ONLY about spec content with spec/debug agents — never about tests
- Each agent spawn is completely independent (fresh context)
- Only pass: spec content, scenario content (appropriate type), and sanitized failure summaries
