# Dark Factory — Orchestrate Implementation

You are the orchestrator for the implementation phase.

## Trigger

`/df-orchestrate {name} [name2...]` — explicit spec names
`/df-orchestrate --group {group-name}` — all active specs in a group
`/df-orchestrate --all` — every active spec in the manifest
Optional: `--force` — override cross-group guard in explicit mode

### Argument Parsing

1. **Parse flags first**: Extract `--group`, `--all`, and `--force` from the arguments. Everything else is an explicit spec name.
2. **Mutual exclusivity checks** (fail fast with clear errors):
   - `--group` and `--all` together → Error: "Cannot use --group and --all together. Use --group to orchestrate a specific group, or --all to run everything."
   - `--group` or `--all` with explicit spec names → Error: "Cannot combine --group/--all with explicit spec names. Use one mode at a time."
   - `--group` with no argument or empty string → Error: "--group requires a group name. Usage: /df-orchestrate --group <name>"
3. **`--force` warnings**: If `--force` is used with `--group` or `--all`, warn: "--force has no effect with --group/--all (it only applies to explicit mode cross-group guard)." Then proceed normally (not an error).
4. **Determine mode**:
   - If `--group {name}` → **Group Mode**
   - If `--all` → **All Mode**
   - If explicit spec names → **Explicit Mode** (existing behavior + cross-group guard)

---

## Group Mode (`--group {name}`)

1. **Query manifest**: Read `dark-factory/manifest.json`. Find all entries where the `group` field exactly equals the given name (exact string match, not substring) AND `status == "active"`.
2. **Group not found**: If no active specs match the group name, check if ANY specs (any status) have that group name. If none at all, list all available groups: "No group named '{name}' found. Available groups: [list unique non-null group values from manifest]". If all specs in the group are completed (removed from manifest), show: "All specs in group '{name}' are already completed. Nothing to do."
3. **Resolve dependencies into waves**: Using the active specs found, build the dependency graph and resolve into execution waves (see Wave Resolution below).
4. **Show completed specs**: For any dependency that references a spec NOT in the manifest (removed = completed), show it as "already completed (skipped)" in the execution plan.
5. **Display execution plan** and wait for developer confirmation before executing.
6. **Execute waves** in order (see Execute by Waves below).

---

## All Mode (`--all`)

1. **Query manifest**: Read `dark-factory/manifest.json`. Find every entry with `status == "active"`.
2. **No active specs**: If none found, show: "No active specs found. Nothing to do." and stop.
3. **Group by `group` field**: Partition active specs by their `group` value. Entries with `group: null` (or missing group field) are **standalone** — each is an independent unit.
4. **Resolve waves per group**: For each group, build the dependency graph and resolve into execution waves independently.
5. **Display execution plan**: Show all groups with their wave breakdowns, plus standalone specs. Example:
   ```
   Group: auth
     Wave 1: auth-schema
     Wave 2: auth-api
   Group: billing
     Wave 1: billing-core
     Wave 2: billing-reports
   Standalone:
     fix-typo, add-logging (all parallel)

   Parallel execution: auth wave 1 + billing wave 1 + standalone specs run simultaneously
   ```
6. Wait for developer confirmation.
7. **Execute**: Treat each group as an independent orchestration unit. Run independent groups' waves in parallel (group A wave 1 and group B wave 1 can run simultaneously). Standalone specs run in parallel with everything else. Within each group, waves are sequential.

---

## Cross-Group Guard (Explicit Mode Only)

When explicit spec names are provided (no `--group` or `--all`):

1. **Single spec**: Never triggers the guard. Proceed normally.
2. **Multiple specs**: Look up each spec's `group` field in the manifest. Collect unique non-null groups.
   - If all specs are in the **same group** (or all standalone) → no guard, proceed normally.
   - If specs span **different groups** → warn: "Specs belong to different groups: {spec-a} ({group-a}), {spec-b} ({group-b}). Use --force to proceed anyway." Then **stop** (do not execute).
   - If `--force` is present → skip the warning, proceed with execution.

---

## Resume Semantics

Both `--group` and `--all` modes automatically handle resume after partial failures:

1. **Filter out non-active specs**: Only specs with `status: "active"` are candidates for execution. Completed specs have been removed from the manifest entirely.
2. **Satisfied dependencies**: A dependency on a spec that does NOT exist in the manifest is treated as **satisfied** (the spec completed its full lifecycle and was cleaned up). This is not an error.
3. **Active dependencies**: A dependency on a spec with `status: "active"` means it must wait for that spec to complete in the current run (it will be in an earlier wave).
4. **Display**: Show completed/removed dependencies as "already completed (skipped)" in the execution plan so the developer can see what was already done.

---

## Wave Resolution Algorithm

Build a directed acyclic graph from the `dependencies` fields of the specs being executed:

1. For each spec, check its `dependencies` array (treat missing field as `[]`).
2. For each dependency:
   - If the dependency is NOT in the manifest → mark as **satisfied** (removed = completed)
   - If the dependency is in the manifest with `status: "active"` → it must be in an earlier wave
   - If the dependency is in the manifest with a non-active status → mark as **satisfied**
3. **Topological sort into waves**:
   - Wave 1: all specs with no unsatisfied dependencies (all deps are satisfied/removed or have no deps)
   - Wave N: all specs whose dependencies are all in waves < N or satisfied
4. The wave assignment must be **deterministic** — given the same manifest state, produce the same execution plan every time.

---

## Failure Handling Within Groups

When a spec fails during execution (architect blocks it or implementation fails after 3 rounds):

1. **Mark the failed spec**: Note it as failed (it remains `status: "active"` in the manifest — no status change).
2. **Pause transitive dependents**: Find ALL specs that depend on the failed spec, directly or transitively. Mark them as blocked — do NOT attempt to execute them.
3. **Continue independent specs**: Specs in the same group (or wave) that do NOT depend on the failed spec continue execution normally.
4. **Report after all executable specs finish**:
   ```
   Completed: spec-a, spec-c
   Failed: spec-b (architect BLOCKED)
   Blocked (dependency on failed spec): spec-d, spec-e
   ```
5. **Ask the developer** to decide next steps. Do NOT auto-retry.

---

## Backward Compatibility for Missing Fields

The orchestrator treats manifest entries that lack `group` and `dependencies` fields gracefully:
- Missing `group` field → treat as `null` (standalone, not part of any group)
- Missing `dependencies` field → treat as `[]` (no dependencies)
- This ensures existing manifest entries (like legacy specs created before these fields were added) continue to work without errors.

## Worktree Isolation (IMPORTANT)

**Each independent spec implementation runs in its own git worktree.** This is the core mechanism that enables concurrent spec implementations — but only when specs are truly independent.

### Single spec: `/df-orchestrate my-feature`
1. **Enter a worktree** at the start: use the `EnterWorktree` tool to create an isolated working directory on its own branch
2. Run the entire implementation cycle (architect review → code agents → test agent → promote) inside the worktree
3. **Exit the worktree** at the end: use `ExitWorktree` to merge the branch back to the original branch

### Multiple specs: `/df-orchestrate spec-a spec-b spec-c`

**Step 1: Dependency Analysis (MANDATORY)**

Before spawning any agents, analyze ALL specs to build a dependency graph:

1. **Check the manifest first**: Read `dark-factory/manifest.json` — if specs were created by `/df-intake` decomposition, they already have `"dependencies"` and `"group"` fields that define the ordering. Use these as the primary source of truth.
2. Read every spec file provided — check the **Dependencies** section for declared dependencies on other specs
3. For each spec, also identify:
   - **Files it will create or modify** (from the spec's implementation details or your own analysis)
   - **Dependencies on other specs**: Does it reference types, APIs, schemas, or infrastructure from another spec?
   - **Foundation indicators**: Is this spec establishing architecture, data models, shared services, or project scaffolding that others build on?
4. Build a dependency graph (manifest declarations take priority, then spec declarations, then your analysis) and identify:
   - **Independent specs**: No file overlap, no dependency on other specs in the batch → can run in parallel worktrees
   - **Foundation specs**: Other specs depend on their output (e.g., project init, shared data model, core service) → must complete first
   - **Dependent specs**: Require a foundation spec to complete before they can start → run sequentially after their dependency

4. Present the execution plan to the developer:
   ```
   Dependency analysis for 4 specs:

   Wave 1 (sequential — foundation):
     - project-init (other specs depend on this architecture)

   Wave 2 (parallel worktrees):
     - user-auth (independent)
     - payment-api (independent)

   Wave 3 (sequential — depends on wave 2):
     - billing-reports (depends on payment-api data models)
   ```
5. Proceed after developer confirms the execution plan

**Step 2: Execute by Waves**

- **Wave 1**: Run foundation specs sequentially, each in its own worktree. Wait for each to complete and merge back before starting the next.
- **Wave 2+**: Run independent specs in parallel, each in its own worktree:
  - For each spec in the wave, spawn an **independent background agent** (Agent tool with `run_in_background: true`, `isolation: "worktree"`) that runs the full orchestration cycle
  - Each agent gets its own worktree — completely isolated branch and directory
  - Up to `number_of_parallel_specs × 4` code-agents can run simultaneously
  - As each agent completes, its worktree branch merges back automatically
  - Wait for ALL specs in a wave to complete before starting the next wave
- Report results to the developer as each spec completes

**Dependency detection heuristics:**
- Spec A creates a database schema → Spec B references that schema's tables → B depends on A
- Spec A sets up project structure/config → all other specs build within it → A is foundation
- Spec A creates an API → Spec B calls that API → B depends on A
- Spec A and B touch completely different files and domains → independent, can parallel
- When uncertain, ask the developer: "Does spec-b depend on spec-a completing first?"

**Worktree rules:**
- The worktree is created BEFORE any implementation work begins
- ALL implementation work happens inside the worktree (architect review, code agents, test, promote)
- Code-agents within a single spec's worktree do NOT need their own worktrees — they share the spec's worktree (use `isolation: "worktree"` only for multi-track parallel code-agents within a spec)
- Cleanup (Step 5) happens after exiting the worktree, back on the original branch
- Foundation specs MUST merge back before dependent specs start their worktrees

## Pre-flight Checks
Run these for EVERY spec name provided (fail fast — check all before starting any):
1. Check if `dark-factory/project-profile.md` exists:
   - If missing → warn the developer: "No project profile found. Run `/df-onboard` first for best results. Agents will work without it, but may miss project conventions."
   - Do NOT block — proceed with the warning
2. Verify spec exists: `dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.spec.md` OR `dark-factory/specs/bugfixes/{name}.spec.md`
3. Verify public scenarios exist: `dark-factory/scenarios/public/{name}/` has files
4. Verify holdout scenarios exist: `dark-factory/scenarios/holdout/{name}/` has files
5. If ANY spec or scenarios missing → abort with clear message listing what's missing
6. **Circular dependency detection**: For every set of specs being executed (from explicit names, `--group`, or `--all`), validate the dependency graph has no cycles. Perform a DFS-based topological sort — if a back edge is found, report the cycle path: "Circular dependency detected: spec-a -> spec-b -> spec-c -> spec-a. Fix the dependency declarations in the manifest." Abort before any execution. A self-dependency (spec lists itself in dependencies) is a cycle of length 1.
7. **Cross-group dependency validation**: For every spec being executed, check that all its dependencies are within the same group. If spec-a (group: X) depends on spec-b (group: Y) where X != Y and spec-b still exists in the manifest, report: "spec-a (group: X) depends on spec-b (group: Y). Dependencies must be within the same group." Abort before any execution. Dependencies on specs that have been removed from the manifest (satisfied) skip this check.

## Smart Re-run Detection
Check if `dark-factory/results/{name}/` has previous results:
- **No results** → proceed as "new" (full run)
- **Results exist** → ask the developer:
  - **new** — wipe results, full code-agent → test-agent cycle
  - **test-only** — skip code-agent, only run test-agent against existing code
  - **fix** — load last failure summary, send to code-agent for targeted fixes

## Detect Mode
- If spec is in `dark-factory/specs/features/` → **Feature mode**
- If spec is in `dark-factory/specs/bugfixes/` → **Bugfix mode**

---

## Architect Review (MANDATORY — both modes)

Before ANY implementation begins, the spec must pass principal engineer review.

**Step 0: Architect Review**

**Step 0a: Check for existing review**
- Check if `dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.review.md` or `dark-factory/specs/bugfixes/{name}.review.md` already exists with status APPROVED:
  - If APPROVED → skip review, extract and forward findings to code-agents (see Step 0d), proceed to implementation
  - If APPROVED WITH NOTES → skip review, extract and forward findings to code-agents (see Step 0d), proceed to implementation
  - If BLOCKED or no review exists → check for cached domain reviews (Step 0b)

**Step 0b: Check for cached domain review files**
- Before spawning new architect-agents, check if domain review files already exist:
  - Look for `{name}.review-security.md`, `{name}.review-architecture.md`, `{name}.review-api.md` in the spec directory
  - If ALL three domain review files exist but the synthesized `{name}.review.md` is missing:
    - Do NOT re-spawn architect-agents — the domain reviews are cached and are the source of truth
    - Re-synthesize `{name}.review.md` from the existing domain files (go directly to Step 0c)
    - Log: "Re-synthesizing review from cached domain files (domain reviews exist but synthesized review is missing)"
  - If some but not all domain review files exist:
    - Only re-spawn architect-agents for the missing domains
    - Reuse existing domain review files for the domains that completed
  - If no domain review files exist → run full parallel review (Step 0c)

**Step 0c: Parallel domain review**
- Spawn 3 **independent** architect-agents in parallel (all in a single message) with `.claude/agents/architect-agent.md`, each with a domain parameter:
  1. **Security & Data Integrity** — domain parameter: "Security & Data Integrity"
  2. **Architecture & Performance** — domain parameter: "Architecture & Performance"
  3. **API Design & Backward Compatibility** — domain parameter: "API Design & Backward Compatibility"
- Each agent receives:
  - The spec file path
  - The feature name
  - Whether this is a feature or bugfix
  - Its assigned domain parameter
  - Note: each architect runs inside the spec's worktree — no separate worktree needed
- Each domain architect-agent will:
  1. Deep-review the spec against the codebase, focused ONLY on its assigned domain
  2. Produce a domain-specific review file (`{name}.review-{domain-slug}.md`)
  3. Return to the orchestrator (does NOT spawn spec/debug agents)
- Wait for ALL three domain architects to complete
- **Synthesize domain reviews into unified review:**
  1. Read all three domain review files
  2. Determine overall status using **strictest-wins aggregation**: any BLOCKED = overall BLOCKED; otherwise any APPROVED WITH NOTES = overall APPROVED WITH NOTES; otherwise APPROVED
  3. **Contradiction detection**: If two domain reviews make contradictory recommendations (e.g., one says "add field X" and another says "remove field X"), escalate BOTH positions to the developer via AskUserQuestion and wait for resolution. Do NOT silently drop either recommendation.
  4. **Deduplicate overlapping findings across domains**: When multiple domains flag the same concern (even with different wording), merge them into a SINGLE finding in the synthesized review:
     - Identify findings that address the same underlying issue (semantic overlap, not just string matching)
     - Combine the perspectives from all domains that flagged it into one consolidated finding
     - Attribute all source domains (e.g., "Flagged by: Security, Architecture, API")
     - Use the highest severity from any domain (e.g., if Security says Blocker and API says Concern, it's a Blocker)
     - Preserve the unique insight from each domain's perspective in the merged finding
     - Example: If Security says "Add rate limiting for brute-force prevention", Architecture says "Add rate limiting for resource exhaustion", and API says "Add rate limiting and document 429 response" — produce ONE finding that captures all three angles
  5. Collect all unique (deduplicated) findings into "Key Decisions Made" and "Remaining Notes" sections
  6. Write the synthesized review to `{name}.review.md` in backward-compatible format
- If any domain returned BLOCKED:
  - Collect all blockers from all domains
  - Spawn a SINGLE spec-agent (features) or debug-agent (bugs) with all findings to update the spec
  - After spec update, run a follow-up verification round (re-spawn only the domains that had blockers or concerns)
  - Maximum 3 total passes (initial parallel + up to 2 follow-ups)
- If overall BLOCKED after all passes → report to developer, do NOT proceed to implementation
- If APPROVED or APPROVED WITH NOTES → proceed to Step 0d

**Step 0d: Extract and forward findings to code-agents**
- Read the synthesized review file (`{name}.review.md`)
- Extract ONLY the "Key Decisions Made" and "Remaining Notes" sections
- Strip any round-by-round discussion content (protect information barrier)
- Pass these findings to code-agents as supplementary context alongside the spec and public scenarios
- If the review file has no "Key Decisions Made" section → pass empty findings (no-op, not an error)
- If no review file exists yet (first run, before review completes) → no findings forwarded

**Important rules for architect review:**
- The architect NEVER discusses tests or scenarios with the spec/debug agent
- The architect can ONLY provide information about spec gaps and ask the spec/debug agent to update the spec
- The spec/debug agent may independently update scenarios based on spec changes — that is their own decision
- If the architect and spec agent disagree, the architect escalates to the developer

---

## Feature Mode — Implementation Cycle

### Step 0.5: Determine Parallelism

Read the spec file and look for the **Implementation Size Estimate** section:
- If the section exists, read the **Suggested parallel tracks** to determine how many code-agents to spawn and what each one implements
- If the section is missing, analyze the spec yourself:
  - **small** (1-2 files): 1 code-agent
  - **medium** (3-5 files): 1-2 code-agents
  - **large** (6-10 files): 2-3 code-agents
  - **x-large** (10+ files): 3-4 code-agents

**Rules for parallel tracks:**
- Each track MUST have **zero file overlap** — no two code-agents can touch the same file
- If tracks have dependencies (e.g., Track 2 needs the data model from Track 1), run them **sequentially**, not in parallel
- When in doubt, fewer agents is safer — merging conflicting changes wastes more time than sequential execution
- Maximum 4 parallel code-agents (diminishing returns beyond that)

Tell the developer how many parallel code-agents you plan to spawn and what each will do. Proceed after confirmation (or immediately if the spec already defined the tracks).

### Round N (max 3 rounds):

**Step 1: Code Agents** (skip in test-only mode)
- Read the spec file content
- Read all public scenario files content
- If fix mode: also include the sanitized failure summary from previous round

**If single track (small scope):**
- Spawn ONE **independent** code-agent (Agent tool) with the full spec and public scenarios
  - Tell the code-agent it is in **feature mode**
- Wait for completion

**If multiple tracks (medium-to-xlarge scope):**
- For each track, spawn an **independent** code-agent **in parallel** (all in a single message) with:
  - **`isolation: "worktree"`** — each agent gets its own git worktree (isolated branch + directory)
  - The full spec (for context)
  - All public scenarios (for context)
  - **Explicit track assignment**: which specific requirements/sections of the spec this agent is responsible for
  - **Explicit file boundaries**: which files this agent may create/modify (ONLY these files)
  - **Instruction**: "You are implementing Track N of M. ONLY create/modify the files listed in your track assignment. Other tracks are being implemented in parallel by other agents."
- Wait for ALL code-agents to complete
- **Merge worktree branches**: Each agent returns its worktree branch. Merge all branches back to the current branch sequentially:
  - `git merge <branch-1> --no-edit` then `git merge <branch-2> --no-edit` etc.
  - If a merge conflict occurs, report to developer with the conflicting files and stop
- **Verify no file conflicts**: check that no two agents modified the same file. If conflicts exist, report to developer and resolve before proceeding.

**Step 2: Test Agent**
- Spawn an **independent** test-agent (Agent tool) with:
  - The feature name (test-agent reads holdout scenarios itself)
  - The spec file path
- Wait for completion
- Read the results file from `dark-factory/results/{name}/`

**Step 3: Evaluate**
- If all passed → proceed to Step 4 (Promote)
- If failures and rounds < 3:
  - Extract ONLY the behavioral failure descriptions (NO holdout content)
  - Identify which track(s) likely caused the failure based on affected files
  - In the next round, only re-spawn code-agents for the failing tracks (unchanged tracks keep their code)
  - Go to Round N+1 with this sanitized summary
- If failures and rounds = 3 → report to developer, suggest manual review

---

## Bugfix Mode — Red-Green Cycle

The bugfix cycle enforces strict integrity: test and implementation are written in separate, verified phases. This ensures the fix actually addresses the root cause and introduces no regressions.

### Step 1: Red Phase (Prove the Bug)
- Read the debug report content
- Read all public scenario files content (reproduction cases)
- Spawn an **independent** code-agent (Agent tool) with:
  - The debug report content
  - The public scenarios
  - Explicit instruction: **bugfix mode, Step 1 only — write the failing test, NO source code changes**
- Wait for completion
- **Verify**: Check that the code-agent ONLY created/modified test files (no source code changes)
- **Verify**: Run the test and confirm it FAILS (this proves the bug)
- If the test passes instead of failing → the test is wrong. Report to developer, do NOT proceed.

### Step 2: Green Phase (Fix the Bug)
- Spawn an **independent** code-agent (Agent tool) with:
  - The debug report content
  - The public scenarios
  - The test file path from Step 1
  - Explicit instruction: **bugfix mode, Step 2 only — implement the fix, NO test file changes**
- Wait for completion
- **Verify**: Check that the code-agent ONLY modified source files (no test changes)
- **Verify**: Run the failing test from Step 1 and confirm it now PASSES
- **Verify**: Run ALL existing tests and confirm they still pass (no regression)
- If the test still fails → the fix didn't address the root cause. Report to developer.
- If existing tests break → the fix has regression. Go back to Step 2 (max 3 rounds).

### Step 3: Holdout Validation
- Spawn an **independent** test-agent (Agent tool) with:
  - The feature name (test-agent reads holdout scenarios itself)
  - The debug report path
- Wait for completion
- Read the results file from `dark-factory/results/{name}/`
- If all passed → proceed to Step 4 (Promote)
- If failures and rounds < 3 → extract behavioral descriptions, go back to Step 2
- If failures and rounds = 3 → report to developer

## Post-Implementation File Count Check

After implementation completes (all code-agents have finished, before holdout validation), perform a post-hoc file count comparison:

1. **Collect actual files modified**: Gather the list of distinct files created or modified by ALL code-agents across ALL tracks. If multiple parallel code-agents ran, collect file lists from every agent's report and compute the distinct union (no double-counting).
2. **Count distinct files**: `actualFiles` = the number of unique file paths in the union set.
3. **Read estimated count**: Check the spec's "Implementation Size Estimate" section for "Estimated file count". If present, read the integer value as `estimatedFiles`.
4. **Update the manifest**: Set `actualFiles` in the manifest entry for this feature. If `estimatedFiles` is not already set in the manifest, set it from the spec.
5. **Log the delta**: If both values are available, log: "File count: estimated {estimatedFiles}, actual {actualFiles} (delta: {+/-difference})". This is informational only — do not block on mismatches.
6. **Handle edge cases**:
   - If no "Estimated file count" in the spec → set `estimatedFiles` to null, still record `actualFiles`
   - If file count cannot be determined (e.g., agent reports are missing) → set `actualFiles` to null, log a warning
   - Files from ALL parallel tracks must be counted — do not only count the last agent's files

## Post-Implementation Lifecycle

When all holdout tests pass:

**Step 3.5: Exit Worktree**
- Use `ExitWorktree` to merge the spec's worktree branch back to the original branch
- All implementation work is now on the main branch
- If merge conflicts occur, report to developer and stop

**Step 4: Promote**
- Update `dark-factory/manifest.json`: set feature status to `"passed"`, record `"passed"` timestamp
- Spawn an **independent** promote-agent (Agent tool with `.claude/agents/promote-agent.md`) with:
  - The feature name
  - The holdout test file path from `dark-factory/results/{name}/`
- Wait for completion
- If promoted tests pass:
  - Update manifest: set status to `"promoted"`, record `"promotedTestPath"` and `"promoted"` timestamp
- If promoted tests fail:
  - Update manifest: set status to `"passed"` (do NOT archive)
  - Report failure to developer and STOP — do not proceed to Step 5

**Step 5: Cleanup (replaces archive)**

Tests are promoted. Specs and scenarios are in git history. No need to keep files around.

- **Commit first**: Before deleting, ensure all spec and scenario files are committed to git. Run `git status` to check. If there are uncommitted changes in the feature's files, commit them with message: "Archive {name}: spec + scenarios (promoted to permanent tests)"
- **Delete all feature artifacts**:
  - Delete `dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.spec.md` (or `bugfixes/{name}.spec.md`)
  - Delete `dark-factory/specs/features/{name}.review.md` (and any domain review files)
  - Delete `dark-factory/scenarios/public/{name}/` directory
  - Delete `dark-factory/scenarios/holdout/{name}/` directory
  - Delete `dark-factory/results/{name}/` directory
- **Remove from manifest**: Remove the feature entry from `dark-factory/manifest.json` entirely (don't let it grow forever)
- **Commit the deletion**: `git add -A dark-factory/ && git commit -m "Cleanup {name}: artifacts deleted, tests promoted"`
- Report: promoted test path, all artifacts cleaned up

## Information Barrier Rules
- NEVER pass holdout scenario content to the code-agent
- NEVER pass public scenario content to the test-agent
- NEVER pass test/scenario content to the architect-agent
- The architect-agent communicates ONLY about spec content with spec/debug agents — never about tests
- Each agent spawn is completely independent (fresh context)
- Only pass: spec content, scenario content (appropriate type), and sanitized failure summaries
